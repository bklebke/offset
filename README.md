# offset
This is a repository tracking a tool I built for educational and exploration purposes, leveraging the Django framework, Plaid API, and some hard coded logic.

The purpose of this web app is to review a user's credit card transaction history, detect which transactions are from gas stations, and based on the location and timestamp, calculate the rough amount of gasoline they purchased (in gallons) given prices. In turn, this allows the app to calculate the amount of CO2 they burned (in lbs), to inform a user's purchase of carbon offsets. Ultimately, this app would help a user drive carbon free, even if their car emits carbon.

(Yes, I know offsets are problematic - it's still a fun project and not _all_ offsets are equally bad.)
